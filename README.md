🚗 Obd-Chat-Diagnostics

OBD Chat Diagnostics is an intelligent vehicle diagnostic assistant that combines On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) data with powerful Machine Learning models (LSTM, LLM) to deliver real-time troubleshooting guidance for users.
Whether you're facing a check engine light or strange car behavior, this app helps decode problems and suggests actionable solutions.
🔥 Features

    OBD Code Interpretation — Understand trouble codes (DTCs) clearly.

    Natural Language Chat — Ask questions like "I have an issue with my brake system" and get meaningful repair advice.

    Model Switching — Choose between LSTM or LLM models for different levels of assistance.

    Voice Input Support — Speak your issues directly instead of typing (optional).

    Minimal, User-Friendly Interface — Clean design optimized for quick diagnostics.

    Future Ready — Easy to extend with more ML models or integrate vehicle-specific features.
